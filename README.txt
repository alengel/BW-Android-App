In order to test the Brandwatch Mobile Android application three programs must be installed on the test machine. Applications required are:


* Eclipse version 3.7.2

* Android plugin for Eclipse version 17.

* Android SDK.



If you are testing the application in the university lab then all of the above applications should already be installed but unfortunately they will require updating to the 
versions mentioned above. These instructions were successfully tested on the university computer 233-C5 with the latest upgrades.



Setting up the Android device:

There are a couple of things that need to be done before being able to use Eclipse to run an application on an Android device.

Instructions can be found on the Android developers website - https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html



Setting up Eclipse:

To test the Android application first copy the folder called "Android" from the CD to your hard drive.
Then open Eclipse and select File/Import.
In the new dialog window select "General\Existing Projects into Workspace" and click Next.
Now select "Select root directory" and click Browse. Select the folder that you copied
from the CD and click OK. Finally click Finish.

In the Android tab select Browse and in the new window select the Brandwatch mobile project.
